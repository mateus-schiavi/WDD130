                            The history of civilization tells us that primitive man sought to defend himself from the cold and hunger, taking shelter in caves and eating wild fruits, or what he could obtain from hunting and fishing. Over the centuries, with the development of intelligence, the human species began to feel the need for greater comfort and to take notice of others. Thus, as a result of individual needs, exchanges emerged.
                            This system of barter, which lasted for several centuries, gave rise to words such as “salary”, the payment made through a certain amount of salt; “pecunia”, from the Latin “pecus”, which means herd (cattle) or “peculium”, relative to the small cattle (sheep or goat).
                            The first coins, as we know them today, pieces representing values, usually in metal, appeared in Lydia (present-day Turkey), in the 7th century BC. ), in primitive guises. It was the emergence of hammer coinage, where monetary signs were also valued for the nobility of the metals used, such as gold and silver.
                            Although the evolution of time has led to the replacement of gold and silver by less rare metals or their alloys, over the centuries, the association of the attributes of beauty and cultural expression with the monetary value of coins has been preserved, which almost always , currently, present figures representing the history, culture, wealth and power of societies.
                            The need to store coins safely gave rise to banks. The gold and silver dealers, having safes and guards at their service, came to accept the responsibility of looking after their customers' money and giving written receipts for the amounts kept. These receipts (then known as “goldsmith's notes”) began, over time, to serve as a means of payment by their holders, as they were safer to carry than cash. Thus, the first “paper money” banknotes, or bank notes, appeared, at the same time that the safekeeping of cash values ​​gave rise to banking institutions.
                            The first officially recognized banks appeared, respectively, in Sweden, in 1656; in England, in 1694; in France, in 1700 and in Brazil, in 1808 and the word “bank” came from the Italian “banco”, a piece of wood that traders of securities from Italy and established in London used to operate their businesses in the London public market.

                            Can be money used in other planets?
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                           Well, my answer for this is: NO. This happens because money is used in countries that has an
                           official currency, like Dollar or Real(Brazilian currency). As far as I know, there's no countries in other planets.
                           So, it is almost impossible to use money in other planets which we know not about ther inner.
                           This is because of outer space treaty, assigned by 91 countries, including Brazil, that has the following rules:
                           Nations cannot make territorial claims over outer space.
                           The Moon and other celestial bodies will be used exclusively for peaceful purposes.
                           Astronauts are the envoys of all humanity.
                           Countries are responsible for their national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities.Also, they are responsible for the damage caused by their space objects and must avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies.
