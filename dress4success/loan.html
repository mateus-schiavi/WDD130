                            What is a Loan?
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            A bank loan is a financial contract between the customer in which the first receives an amount that must be delivered to the bank within a specified period, plus the agreed interest. The resources obtained have no specific destination.
                            Is it the same as funding?
                            Almost. Although financing, as well as financing, also constitute a contract between a customer and a financial institution, they have the difference that they have a specific destination for the financial resources. 
                            Such as, for example, financing for the purchase of a vehicle, or real estate.
                            And, generally, financing requires a type of guarantee, such as, for example, fiduciary alienation or mortgage.

                        <p>
                            Flexibility: When you receive a bank loan, the bank will not provide a set of rules dictating how you spend the money. 
                            While venture capitalists and angel investors will restrict what you can do with the money, bank loans can provide you the flexibility to spend the money where you see fit. 
                            Whether you need capital to purchase new equipment, enter a new market, or carry out a new marketing plan, you can use the money from a bank loan.
                            Maintain Control: You do not have to give up equity to get a loan from a bank. Venture capitalists and angel investors typically require you to give them equity or some say in your company. 
                            However, this is only true if you make your payments to the bank on time.

                            Requires Profitability: 
                            While venture capitalists and angel investors usually take risks to invest in companies that haven’t yet proved profitable, banks will take no such risk. 
                            To be eligible, your company must be consistently profitable, which disqualifies the majority of startups.

                            Complicated: Obtaining a bank loan is extremely time consuming. 
                            You will be required to fill out excessive paperwork, and the terms of interest will be quite complicated. 
                            The process will not be quick either, often, it takes several months to qualify and obtain capital from a bank.
                            Compared to other financing options, bank loans serve as one of the most difficult to obtain.

                            Borrowing money is a big financial step, and it can help you or hurt you—depending on how you manage it. 
                            The most substantial loan you'll ever take out is your home mortgage. 
                            If you can afford a sizable down payment and it's a home that is within (or below) your means, it might mean taking out a loan is worth it.

                            But it depends of which type of business you pretend to apply your borrowing money.
                            Just be careful about the amount of money you are pretending to ask for.

            As you can see, money has its advantages and its disavantages. Its main function is to provide
            a better lifestyle, but it depends on how do you use it. Remember: If you use money wisely, it you help you
            to reach good things, like a better house or a good car, but if you don't use it wisely, it will make you more and more poor.
            <br>

            There's a famous phrase of Thomas Jefferson: "Never waste your money before receiving it."
